# france-connect

France Connect is an identification and authentication system for people which is managed by the French Government.

Alan believes in simplifying the user experience with all formalities, and contributing to France Connect fits in this mission.

This tutorial is meant to set up with a working test for France Connect using Python/Flask.

The documentation for France Connect is here: https://partenaires.franceconnect.gouv.fr

## Installation

After cloning the repo, here are the few steps to get you started:

### Python

Install Python 3. You can follow [this guide](http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### Flask server

- Create and prepare your virtual env and activate it:

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Add the right keys and tokens
Visit [France Connect](https://partenaires.franceconnect.gouv.fr/monprojet/decouverte).
Click the `Editer le FS` button.

On top, you'll get the `client_id` and the `client_secret`. You will need these in your `app.py`.

You also need to generate a random id (it can be anything) as your `app.secret_key`.

### Setup ngrok to handle callbacks
- Install ngrok from [here](https://ngrok.com/download).

- Run it with your favorite port (we'll use 5000 here):

```
ngrok http 5000
```

- Ngrok will provide you with a callback address, such as: 
```
https://7f132061.ngrok.io
```
You'll want to use `https://7f132061.ngrok.io/france_connect` as the callback address.

- Put the callback address with  in the `Urls de callback` from France Connect's partenaire page.

- You can also add `https://7f132061.ngrok.io` as an `Url de d√©connexion`.

## Run the server
- Run the server on `127.0.0.1:5000`:

```
python app.py
```

- You can access [](http://127.0.0.1:5000) to test your endpoint.

### Create test data
You can create test data using France Connect's tool [here](https://fip1.integ01.dev-franceconnect.fr/user/create).

## Enjoy
And you're all set to test France Connect by clicking on your [local site](http://127.0.0.1:5000)!
